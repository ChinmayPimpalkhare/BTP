Yessss! We have finally been able to figure out how to create the Geometry From Edges and this will speed up the 
simulations by a huge margin.


The MATLAB File being used is named 'sim_group_2.mlx' and needs to be modified. 

Guidelines for the simulations
1. Material used will be Structural Steel 
	-- Thermal Conductivity = 
	-- Specific Heat = 
	-- Density = 
2. Crack location shall be varied only along the x-axis
3. All units being used are the default ones. 
4. Crack width should be around 0.001*dimension of plate
