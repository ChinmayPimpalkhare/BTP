This is the group of simulations being done on the STL files created in SolidWorks. They can be found in the STL_Files folder. 

Here we shall use the original "Multicuboid Matlab Script", however instead of automation, we shall currently perform the
simulations manually. 

QA Guidelines for saving simulation result files: 
1. Save in an image
2. Name format: "<STL File ID>_<Simulation Number> 
3. The STL File IDs need to be stored in an Excel spreadsheet: "Sim_Group_1" 
4. The Boundary conditions shall also have to be stored inside the Excel spreadsheet


Material for all simulations is assumed to be Structural Steel
1. Thermal Conductivity = 20
