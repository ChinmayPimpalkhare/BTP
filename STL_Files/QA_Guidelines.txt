Each STL File needs to be renamed in the following format 
-1. Whether there is a crack or not. "Yes: y", "No: n"  
0. Nature of the crack. "Surface: sur", "Penetrating: pen", "No crack: nil"


When -1 = y, the rest must be filled in the following way
1. Crack Location (Lx and Ly): where Lx and Ly are measured considering the left bottom corner of the steel plate to be the origin. 
	Consider left vertical and lower horizontal edges. 
	Lx and Ly should be 2 digit numbers with no decimals (so if Lx = 67.8, it should be written as 678)
2. Length of the crack: l (a.bc ---> abc)
3. Width of the crack: w (0.abc --> abc) 
4. Penetration Depth of the crack (d) (a.b --> ab)  

Only a single file should be enough for -1 = n, so no need to append

All values need to be in mm.
Further, the dimensions of the steel plate are to be taken as 100mm by 100mm by 10mm


File format examples: 

y_pen_12_50_101_020_05
n_nil
